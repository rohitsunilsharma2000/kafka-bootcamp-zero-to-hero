Here are **Top 10 Scenario-Based Apache Kafka Interview Questions**, ranging from **basic to complex** level, commonly asked for **Java backend/Kafka developer roles**:

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Basic Level (1â€“3): Understanding Core Kafka Concepts**

### **1. What happens if a Kafka consumer crashes while processing a message? How do you ensure no message is lost or reprocessed?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Offset management, auto commit, manual commit
ðŸ“Œ *Follow-up:* Explain `enable.auto.commit`, `commitSync()` vs `commitAsync()`

---

### **2. Can Kafka retain messages even after they are consumed?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Retention policy vs log compaction
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* A downstream system wants to reprocess 7-day old data

---

### **3. How do Kafka partitions improve scalability? What are the trade-offs of increasing partition count?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Partitioning strategy, ordering guarantees, consumer parallelism
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Topic A has 50 partitions, but you need strict ordering

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Intermediate Level (4â€“7): Production Use Cases & Failures**

### **4. You have 10 Kafka consumers in a group but only 3 partitions. What happens?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Consumer group rebalancing, idle consumers
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Discuss pros/cons of adding more partitions or consumers

---

### **5. How would you ensure *exactly-once processing* of messages in Kafka?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Idempotent producer, Kafka transactions, consumer retries
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* A payment service processes user transactions via Kafka

---

### **6. A Kafka consumer is reprocessing messages multiple times. What could be the reasons?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Offset commit strategy, processing exceptions, retries
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Consumer crashes after processing but before commit

---

### **7. A message is published but not visible to the consumer. What could be wrong?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Uncommitted transactions, log retention, topic configuration
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Message seen in Kafka UI but not consumed by service

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Advanced Level (8â€“10): Performance, Resilience & Architecture**

### **8. How would you design a Kafka-based system to handle 1 million events per second with minimal delay?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Batching, compression, partition tuning, acks
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Ingest IoT sensor data with <100ms latency requirement

---

### **9. How do you handle dead letter queues (DLQs) in Kafka?**

âœ… *Concepts:* Error handling, retries, Kafka Streams or consumer patterns
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Failing messages must be rerouted and reviewed later

---

### **10. How would you monitor Kafka consumer lag and handle backpressure in real time?**

âœ… *Concepts:* `ConsumerLag`, `max.poll.records`, Prometheus, alerts
ðŸ“Œ *Scenario:* Prevent OOM when consumer lags behind producer
